\section{Necessity Criterion, and The Scientific Attitude}

What are the two pieces of the scientific attitude? \\ \vspace{2cm}

In Ch. 4 of \textit{The Scientific Attitude}, we begin to understand how the scientific attitude can form a ``necessity criterion'' for science, given that there is a scientific community willing and able to discern if the scientific attitude is being applied correctly to a field.  For each field in Tab. \ref{tab:1}, follow the prompt to decide whether or not it is a form of science based on this criterion.

\begin{table}[ht]

\begin{tabular}{| c | c | c | c |}
\hline
Criterion & Type & Field & Yes/No \\ \hline \hline
If \textit{field} is scientific, then it follows \textit{the scientific attitude}. & Necessity & Physics & \\ \hline
If \textit{field} is scientific, then it follows \textit{the scientific attitude}. & Necessity & Particle Physics (e.g. Big Bang) & \\ \hline
If \textit{field} is scientific, then it follows \textit{the scientific attitude}. & Necessity & Quantitative Sociology & \\ \hline

\section{Leadership Characteristics}

\textit{Essay development.}  Given what we have read about leadership qualities, outline a concise essay below that describes a moment in your life when you had to demonstrate these qualities.  Your essay should be approximately 1000 words.  In addition to describing a moment in your life, you should draw a connection to the character qualities that make for good science as shown in Ch. 3 of the book.
