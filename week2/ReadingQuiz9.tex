\section{Necessary and/or Sufficient Characteristics}

In Ch. 4 of \textit{The Scientific Attitude}, we begin to understand how the scientific attitude is not a ``complete solution'' to the demarcation problem in the sense that its two tenets are not necessary and sufficient conditions that demarcate science from non-science.  For each field in Tab. \ref{tab:1}, follow the prompt to decide whether or not it is a form of science.

\section{Leadership Characteristics}

\textit{Essay development.}  Given what we have read about leadership qualities, outline a concise essay below that describes a moment in your life when you had to demonstrate these qualities.  Your essay should be approximately 1000 words.  In addition to describing a moment in your life, you should draw a connection to the character qualities that make for good science as shown in Ch. 3 of the book.
