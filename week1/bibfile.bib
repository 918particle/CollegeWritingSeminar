abstract = {{On May 21, 2019 at 03:02:29 UTC Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo observed a short duration gravitational-wave signal, GW190521, with a three-detector network signal-to-noise ratio of 14.7, and an estimated false-alarm rate of 1 in 4900 yr using a search sensitive to generic transients. If GW190521 is from a quasicircular binary inspiral, then the detected signal is consistent with the merger of two black holes with masses of 85-14+21 M⊙ and 66-18+17 M⊙ (90\% credible intervals). We infer that the primary black hole mass lies within the gap produced by (pulsational) pair-instability supernova processes, with only a 0.32\% probability of being below 65 M⊙. We calculate the mass of the remnant to be 142-16+28 M⊙, which can be considered an intermediate mass black hole (IMBH). The luminosity distance of the source is 5.3-2.6+2.4 Gpc, corresponding to a redshift of 0.82-0.34+0.28. The inferred rate of mergers similar to GW190521 is 0.13-0.11+0.30 Gpc-3 yr-1.}},

abstract = {{We describe the observation of GW170104, a gravitational-wave signal produced by the coalescence of a pair of stellar-mass black holes. The signal was measured on January 4, 2017 at 10∶11:58.6 UTC by the twin advanced detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory during their second observing run, with a network signal-to-noise ratio of 13 and a false alarm rate less than 1 in 70 000 years. The inferred component black hole masses are 31.2−6.0+8.4M⊙ and 19.4−5.9+5.3M⊙ (at the 90\% credible level). The black hole spins are best constrained through measurement of the effective inspiral spin parameter, a mass-weighted combination of the spin components perpendicular to the orbital plane, χeff=−0.12−0.30+0.21. This result implies that spin configurations with both component spins positively aligned with the orbital angular momentum are disfavored. The source luminosity distance is 880−390+450 Mpc corresponding to a redshift of z=0.18−0.07+0.08. We constrain the magnitude of modifications to the gravitational-wave dispersion relation and perform null tests of general relativity. Assuming that gravitons are dispersed in vacuum like massive particles, we bound the graviton mass to mg≤7.7×10−23 eV/c2. In all cases, we find that GW170104 is consistent with general relativity.}},

doi = {10.1109/iwem.2014.6963645}, 
abstract = {{This paper presents a design of a quasi-millimeter wave wideband antenna array consisting of a leaf-shaped bowtie antenna (LSBA) and series-parallel feed networks in which parallel strip and microstrip lines are employed. A 16-element LSBA array is designed such that the antenna array operates over the frequency band of 22–30GHz. In order to demonstrate the effective performance of the presented configuration, characteristics of the designed LSBA array are evaluated by the finite-difference time domain (FDTD) analysis and measurements. Over the frequency range from 22GHz to 30GHz, the simulated reflection coefficient is observed to be less than −8dB, and the actual gain of 12.3–19.4dBi is obtained.}},
