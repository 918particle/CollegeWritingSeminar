\textbf{Week 4}: \textit{Technical description II:} We will focus in Week 4 on the passage of time, and describing technically
procedures in the passive voice.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Exercises: write about a simple experiment you perform at home with household items in the present tense, and then change the writing to passive voice.
\item Exercises: write about a simple experiment you perform at home with household items, and practice removing the subject pronouns.
\item Homeworks: describe a personal acheivement you experienced in high school, but include ample usage of passive voice and technical descriptive language.
\item Midterm: The midterm will be due at the end of Week 4, involving a take-home style exam testing what concepts the student has gained up to this point.
\item Exploration topic: Vaccines
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Tense and scientific/technical writing:} As a general rule, stay with \textit{simple past} if it fits.  Example of exceptions: equations or general knowledge.
\begin{itemize}
\item ``We mixed the solution.''
\item ``We observed the herd migrating north.''
\item ``We recorded a top speed of 110 km/h.''
\end{itemize}
Exception: equations or other general knowledge not under investigation or experiment.
\begin{itemize}
\item ``Newton's 2nd law is written as $\vec{F} = m\vec{a}$.'' Not: \textit{was written}, because it has not changed.
\item ``Population dynamics of large herbivores is generally accepted to follow the pattern ... .'' Not: \textit{was generally accepted}.  General, unchanged knowledge being used here.

\section{Reversing the Usual Order}

\begin{frame}{Reversing the Usual Order: Object and Subject}
\textbf{Science is not personal.}  We study nature through experiment and reveal the results.  It should not matter who we are, because we are not nature. Therefore, it sounds strange when we write: \\ \vspace{0.25cm}
\textit{I observed the primate behavior to include management of scarce resources.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Identify the subject and object.
\item Remove the subject (the science is not about the observer).
\item Move the subject into the position of the object.
\item Modify the past tense verb into the appropriate conjugation or form.
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Reversing the Usual Order: Object and Subject}
\textbf{Science is not personal.} Examples:
\begin{enumerate}
\item ``I secured the weather station to the tallest rock on the plain.'' \textit{The weather station was secured to the tallest rock on the plain.}
\item ``We recorded the internal temperature of the lab mouse.'' \textit{The internal temperature of the lab mouse was recorded.}
\end{enumerate}
This style is called \alert{passive voice}.
\end{frame}

\textbf{Switch to passive voice.} \\
We measured the average commute time of a typical Whittier College student via the following procedure. First, we obained a full roster of students through the Registrar.  Second, we created a generic email form, and we asked the students to write down their commute times for 10 consecutive school days, and report the average.  The for requires the student to report the type of transporation they used to travel to campus.  Third, we organized the data into a histogram, and the average commute time was 42
minutes.  We found that the variation about the mean was 15 minutes.

\textbf{Review: Switch to passive voice, and also remove ambiguous words.} \\
First, you harvest the Antarctic ice by drilling a fairly deep hole in the ice sheet, and you separate the ice core into somewhat shorter segments.  After you store the ice core segments and transport them to the lab bench, you systematicaly melt the core segments with a very hot wire wrapped around the core inside a gas chamber.  You suction the gas into a canister.  Second, you perform mass spectrometry on the gas in the canister corresponding to the segment.  Finally, you calculate the ratio of oxygen isotopes in the gas, which is somewhat correlated with average atmospheric temperature when air bubbles were trapped in the ice.  Since you know that the deeper the air bubbles, the older the air trapped inside, you can graph the average air temperature versus time over the centuries.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Reversing the Usual Order: Object and Subject}
\textbf{Convert each to passive voice, but keep the tense the same:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item ``We derive the acceleration due to gravity from the period of the pendulum and its length.''
\item ``We measured the thermal coefficient of the insulation.''
\item ``Using the parallax technique, I found the distance to alpha centauri.''
\item ``Using general relativity, we found an equation for the radius of the black hole.''
\item ``The vaccine renders the patient immune to the disease.''
\item ``The vaccine rendered the patient immune to the disease.''
\item ``Super-spreaders innoculated the population of the building through rapid community spread.''
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\section{Writing about a DIY Experiment}

\begin{frame}{Writing about a DIY Experiment}
\small
\textbf{\alert{You are in your house anyways, so why not experiment?}} Write down the process for completing an experiment in your house.  Examples are listed below.  Research how to accomplish your chosen project.  Write down a cohesive set of instructions in passive voice with technically accurate language \footnote{In the near future you will exchange documents with a partner and perform the task, so make sure it is doable.}.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Create a compass with a needle, magnetizing magnet, cork, and bowl of water
\item Measure the acceleration of gravity from the period of a pendulum
\item Create a ``homopolar'' motor with a copper wire and a magnet
\item Create a lemon battery
\item Measure the acceleration of gravity by timing the fall of an object
\end{enumerate}
