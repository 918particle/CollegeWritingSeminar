\section{Modern Medicine: The Scientific Attitude}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Louis Pasteur was known for the proverb: ``Chance favors the prepared mind.'' Within the context of the development of modern medicine between (1860-1940), what do you think he meant by this saying? \\ \vspace{3cm}
\item Describe the development of penicillin from faulty experiment in Alexander Fleming's lab to mass-delivered antibiotic medication. \\ \vspace{2cm}
\item In another famous example (earlier than penicillin), scientists Joseph Henry and Michael Faraday noticed that electric currents and fields are generated when we perform a certain action with a magnetic field.  Watch the following video: \url{https://youtu.be/pQp6bmJPU_0} and draw a comparison to the moments of curiosity between the physicists and Alexander Fleming.
