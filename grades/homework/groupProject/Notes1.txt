1) Paragraph 1: "The ability to photograph black holes has been a mystery to scientists and the
general public for a decent amount of time."  We need to apply concise writing techniques here (cut "for a decent amount of time.")
2) Paragraph 1, third sentence: Discoveries is used twice.  Use it once to be more concise.
3) Paragraph 1, second to last sentence: cut this sentence
4) Paragraph 2: define VLBI as an acronymn
5) The discussion of magnetic tapes versus computer hard drives is less necessary than explaining the fiber optic
6) Paragraph 2: cut "at the time they want"
7) Very nice description of complex, symmetric and anti-symmetric brightness components.  This takes literally complex numbers and converts it into a simple clear discussion, well done.
8) Paragraph 3: We don't have to define VLBI twice here
9) Paragraph 3: The most important part of this paragraph is the second half of it, which lists the array locations and distances, and explains why the array needs to be that large.
10) Paragraph 4: concise writing, delete "from around the world"
11) Paragraph 4: The last several sentences can be combined into two sentences.  For example:

"This is important because scientists have been using Albert
Einstein’s theory of general relativity for over a hundred years, and finally with the ability
to photograph a black hole, scientists can confirm if Einstein’s theory holds true in
actuality."

change to

"The Event Horizon Telescope image of the supermassive black hole in M87 allows scientists to confirm or reject the theory of general relativity for black holes."
