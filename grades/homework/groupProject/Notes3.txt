Paragraph 1: This was almost the perfect opening paragraph.  I was like yes...yes, right! Wait wut??? When I read the part about how neutrinos produce fluctuations in gravitational waves.  I don't think they do, unless you mean that they could be generated from the same sources as gravity waves.  There's exactly one neutrino IceCube has observed from a source that was reported to be a neutron-star merger, so there were probably gravity waves produced there.

Paragraph 2: Again, great writing, summarizing neutrino physics and 2 km cables, with light and current and all that.  One major error is that the neutrinos don't have to hit another neutrino to produce the light.  They have to hit a nucleus, which then generates a blob of light that is detected.

Paragraph 2: "Through detecting Neutrinos scientists are able to use the data collected to detect" The paragraph should be split off here, or shortened.  The second part of this long paragraph is about something different, which is that the ice is required because it allows us to see the light.

Paragraph 3: This is also well-written, and the main thing I would do is to cut the last sentence.  The use of quotation and citation is nice, because it tell me I can trust the numbers written there about detected neutrinos being from astrophysical sources and not originating in the Milky Way.

Paragraph 4: Put a period right before "according to FermiLab," to make this sentence flow better.

Paragraph 4: "are detected and studied is just as important as to why they're being studied." I think this is a sentence fragment, no?

Other than these minor issues (neutrinos don't generate gravity waves), I thought this was a good piece of work.

9 out of 10 points.  Well done!
