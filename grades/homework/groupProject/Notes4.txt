Paragraph 1: Fantastic, no notes.  So good... ahhh one thing.  It's "Dark Matter," not "black matter." oops hehe
Paragraph 2: Again, super good.  There are only a few things: 

"86 shafts were drilled total, with IceCube containing 60 digital optical modules, each roughly the size of a basketball and protected from the iceâ€™s pressure by borosilicate glass."

We don't usually start a sentence with a number, or if we do, we write it.  Also there's a missing word in that first phrase.  Let's try this:

"Eighty-six shafts, each containing sixty digital optical modules the size of basketballs, were constructed within the ice at the South Pole.  The modules are protected from the ice pressure by borosilicate glass."

Paragraph 3: No notes, sounds good to me!  I would just delete phrases like "as is," which are not necessary.

10 out of 10 points.  +1 bonus for including the nice bibliography
